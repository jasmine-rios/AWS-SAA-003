## Amazon Timestream

Amazon Timestream is a fast, scalable serverless time-series database for Internet of Things (IoT) and operational applications

Makes it easy to store and analyze trillions of events a day

Kepps recent data in memory and moves historical data to cost-optimized storage tier based upon user-defined policies

Has a purpose-built query engine that allows to analyze this data without needing to specify if the data is in memory or a cost-optimized tier

Has a built-in-time-series analytics funtion to help identify trends and patterns in near real-time

It is serverless and automatically scales up and down to adjust for capacity and performance

### High Performance at Low Cost

Timestream is designed to facilitate interactive and affortable real-time analytics

Has product features such as scheduled queries, mult-measure records, and data storage tiering

You can proccess, store, and analyze your time-series data at a fraction of the cost of existing time-series solutions

Helps you derieve faster and more-affortable insights from your data so you can continue to make more data-driven business decisions

### Serverless with Auto Scaling

This is serverless which means no servers to manage and no capacity to provision

Gives you the scale to process trillions of event and millions of queries a day

Automatically scales to adjust for capacity

### Data lifecycle management

Simplifies the complex process of data management

Offers storage tiering with a memory store for recent data and magnetic store for historical data

Automates transfer of data from memory store to magnetic store based on user-configurable policies

### Simplifed data access

You no longer have to use disparate tools to access recent and historical data

Has a purpose-build query engine that transparently accessses and combines data across storage tiers without you having to specify the data location

### Purpose-built for Time Series

You can analyze time-series data using SQL using built-in time series functions for smoothing, approximation, and interpolation

Also supports advanced aggregates, windows functions, and complex data types such as arrays and rows

### Always Encrypted

Ensures data is always encrypted at rest or in transit

You can also specifiy AWS Key Management (AWS KMS) customer managed key for encrypting data in the magnetic store

### Use Case: IoT sensor data capture architecture

1. You use *Amazon SQS* to have sensor data sit in quenue to be processed by *AWS Lambda*

2. This event triggers the *AWS Lamabda* to initiate a function that loads the message into the Timestream table for data storage

3. *Amazon Timestream* serves as a first-stage repository for all messages sent to the *Amazon SQS* quenue

4. *Amazon EMR* gathers this data from Timestream and processes it then stores it in a *S3 data lake*

5. Once stored in the data lake, *Amazon Athena* can query the data

## Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (Amazon QLDB)

### What is Amazon QLDB?

It is a fully managed ledger database that provides a transparent, immutable, and cryptographically verifiable transaction log 

This log is owned by a centeral trusted authority

QLDB tracks each and every application data change and maintains a complete and verifiable history of changes over time.

Storage is billed per GB per month

IOs consumed are billed per million requests

Data transfer charges are based on data transfer IN and data transfer OUT

No charge between QLBD interacting with other AWS services within the same region

### Use Case: Delivering Cryptographically Secure and Verifiable Medical Data

Medical companies use QLDB to maintain their records.

It is not as optimized as others for one-time search, analytics, and reporting, although these are possible

This is how the architecture is configured:

1. *ElastiCache for Memcached* caches user session data to provide near real-time response times
2. *AWS Elastic Benstalk* deploys and runs the frontend and application logic
    It offloads the operational work of deployent, patching, and scaling
3. *Amazon QLDB* maintains and stores unfalsable an crypto verifiable records of medical histories
    Successful transactions are streamed to Amazon RDS database fir searching and analytics
4. Data is sent from QLDB and then exported by *Kinesis Data Streams* to Amazon RDS to be queried 
5. Since Amazon QLDB is not optimized for ad-hoc search, reporting, and analytics, the successful transactions are placed into *Amazon RDS* instead
   Amazon QLDB remains the database used for a system of record.

## Amazon ElastiCache

### What is Amazon ElastiCache?

It offers managed Redis and memcached distributed in-memory caches using nodes for frequent reads instead of going to the database

Seamlessly deploy, run, and scale popular open source-compatible, in-memory data stores

Build data-intensive apps or improve the performance of your existing apps by retrieving data from high throughput and low latency in-memory data stores

Pay only for what you use, no minimum fee

ElastiCache provides storage for one database snapshot at no charge

Each additional snapshot is charged per gigabyte per month

You are only charged for the data transfer in or out of your Amazon EC2 instance

There is no ElastiCache data transfer charge for traffic in or out of the ElastiCache node itself

ElastiCache supports two nodes types:
    - On-demand
    - Reserved

### On-demand Nodes

You pay for memory capacity by the hour with no long-term commitments

Pricing is per node/hour consumed from the time you launch a node until you terminate it

### Reserved Nodes

You save up to 75% over on-demand rates by commiting for a one or three-year term 
ElatiCache supports two engines:
    - Redis
    - Memcached

### Redis

Redis supports complex data types, data replication, and high avaliability 

It is ideal for sesion caching, full page caching, message quenue applications, leader boards and much more

### Memcached

Is for data that is relatively small and static

For example, a static HTML page or JavaScript and CSS files

Performance is increased instead of waiting for database and Disk I/O

### Use Case: Word Press Database Cache Architecture

When database access is causing performance problems for an application, an in-memory cache can improve latency, increase throughput, and ease the load on the database

For this use case, this architecture is one way you can serve cache items in less than a millisecound and scale cost effectively

1. Mobile client connects to WordPress website through *Amazon EC2*
2. The database is Auroa and uses *ElastiCache* to store data for the website
   It holds a copy of data retrieved from the database for the specified period of time
   The only time the database is accessed is when noncached data is required
3. *Amazon Aurora* stores all the data for the website

### Use Case: Scalable Distrubuted Cache Architecture

To address scalabililty and provide a shared data storage for sessions that can be accessible from any individual web sever

You can abstract the HTTP sessions from the web servers themselves by storing them in a remote cache like ElastiCache

1. *Elastic Load Balancer* distributes traffic between two Amazon EC2 web servers
2. *Amazon EC2* instances are hosyomg the web application and are configured in an Auto Scaling group across two AZs
3. *ElastiCache* distributes the session information across four cache nodes in two different AZs

## Amazon MemoryDB for Redis
Amazon MemoryDB for Redis is a Redis-compatible, durable, in-memory database service that delivers ultra-fast performance. It is purpose-built for modern applications with microservices architectures.

MemoryDB is compatible with Redis, a popular open-source datastore

giving customers the ability to quickly build applications using the same flexible and friendly Redis data structures, application programming interfaces (APIs), and commands that they already use today. 

With MemoryDB, all your data is stored in memory, so you can achieve microsecond read and single-digit millisecond write latency and high throughput

MemoryDB also stores data durably across multiple Availability Zones using a distributed transactional log to facilitate fast failover, database recovery, and node restarts

Delivering both in-memory performance and Multi-AZ durability,

Amazon MemoryDB can be used as a high-performance primary database for your microservices applications, eliminating the need to separately manage both a cache and durable database

### Build Web and Mobile Applications
Use versatile Redis data structures such as 
        streams, lists, and sets 
to build content data stores, chat and message queues, and geospatial indexes for demanding, data-intensive web and mobile applications that require low latency and high throughput

### Quickly Access Customer Data for Retail

Deliver personalized customer experiences and manage user profiles, preferences, and inventory tracking and fulfillment with microsecond read and single-digit millisecond write latency

### Develop Online Games

Build player data stores, session history, and leaderboards for gaming applications that require massive scale, low latency, and high concurrency to make real-time updates

### Stream Media and Entertainment

Run high-concurrency streaming data feeds to ingest user activity and support millions of requests per day for media and entertainment applications

### Use Case: Redis Data Structures for Microservices

Redis is an extremely popular choice for low-latency, high-throughput requirements within containerized workloads

Redis has become a preferred in-memory layer for many enterprise organizations and startups

Here, Python microservices on Amazon ECS and MemoryDB for Redis as the backend primary database

1. Clients access the application from a browser
   The *application load balancer* is the first step in the architecture. From their data is sent to application containers
2. Container-based microservices are deployed to *Amazon ECS*
3. *AWS Fargate* is used to help create and update application that need to be built
4. The application code is deployed into container images and hosted in *Amazon ECR* and configured using an ECS task definition
5. The microservices interact with *MemoryDB for Redisz8 using the open-source redis-py-cluster aware client
   The application code also usees Flask to configure a simple API
   Although the application is built using a shared MemoryDB for Redis cluster, microservices patterns allow independent clusters to be used in a database-per-service model
   MemoryDB for Redis supports ACLs which can restrict user access to certain keys, and commmands based on an access string
6. The *CI/CD pipeline* is the final step, making continous updates and improvements to the application and the ECR
