# AWS Solutions Architect Associate Renewal Notes 2025

This is a study guide I am using to renew my AWS Solutions Architect Associate

I prepared using AWS Skill Builder Standard Exam Prep Plan: AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate

The notes are based off the following materials in that learning plan:
