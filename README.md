This is a study guide I am using to renew my AWS Solutions Architect Associate

I prepared using AWS Skill Builder Standard Exam Prep Plan: AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate

[https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/learning-plans/2198/plan]

The notes are based off the following materials in that learning plan:
- AWS Well-Architected Foundations
- Introduction to Building with AWS Database
- Exam Prep Standard Course: AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate
