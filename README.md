# AWS Solutions Architect Associate Renewal Notes 2025

This is a study guide I am using to renew my AWS Solutions Architect Associate in 2025 (first exam in 2021).

I prepared using AWS Skill Builder Standard Exam Prep Plan: AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate

[https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/learning-plans/2198/plan]

The notes are based off the following materials in that learning plan:
- AWS Well-Architected Foundations
- Introduction to Building with AWS Database
- Exam Prep Standard Course: AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate

## Additional Resources
These are additional resources I used to study with when I orginally got the certificate in 2022 and/or used when renewing in 2025
