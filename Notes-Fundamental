# Module 4 Deep Dive on the Operational Excellence Pillar

There is 6 pillars of Well-Architected:

  - Operational Excellence
  - Security
  - Reliability
  - Performance Efficiency
  - Cost Optimization
  - Sustainability

Operational Excellence: Ability to support workloads effectively, gain insight on operations, and improve supporting proceses to deliver buisness value.

Op Ex Design Priciples:
  - Perform operations as code.
  - Make frequent, small, reversible changes.
  - Refine operartions procedures frequently.
  - Anticipate failure.
  - Learn from all operational failures.

## Op Ex Best Practices

Op Ex Best Practices Focus Areas:
  - Organization
  - Prepare
  - Operate
  - Evolve

### Organization Focus Area

Organization Priorities
  - Evaluate external customer needs
  - Evaluate internal customer needs
  - Evaluate governance requirements
  - Evaluate compliance requirements
  - Evaluate threat landscape
  - Evaluate trade-offs
  - Manage benefits and risks

Operating Models:
  - Application Engineering
  - Application Operations
  - Platform Engineering 
  - Platform Operations

Application Engineering: Business software that is custom developed or commerical off the shelf that that developed, built, and tested.
Application Operations: Deploying buisness software and then operating and managing applications in production.
Platform Engineering: Building infrastructure that the Application will run on such as Computer, Network, Storage, etc.
Platform Operations: Mantaining and supporting the platform in production.

## Organization Culture
Provide support for team members so they can be more effective at operating:
  - Executive Sponsorship
  - Team members are empowered to take action when outcomes are at risks
  - Escalation is encouraged
  - Communications are timely, clear, and actionable
  - Experimentation is encouraged
  - Team members are empowered, encouraged to maintain and grow skill sets
  - Resource teams appropriately
  - Diverse opinions are encouraged and sought within and across teams

## Prepare Focus area

### Design Telemetry
Design your workload so it provides information necessary for you to understand its internal state:
  - Implement application telemetry
  - Implement and configure workload telemetry
  - Implement user activity telemetry
  - Implement dependency telemetry
  - Implement transaction traceability

### Design for Operations

  - Use version control
  - Test and validate changes
  - Use configuration management systems
  - Peform patch management
  - Share design standards
  - Implement practices to imporve code quality
  - Use multiple environments
  - Make frequent, small, reversible changes
  - Fully automate integration and deployment

### Mitigate Deployment Risks
  - Plan for unsuccessful changes
  - Test and Validate Changes
  - Use Deployment Management Systems
  - Test Using Limited Deployments
  - Deploy using parallel environments
  - Deploy frequent, small, reversible changes
  - Fully automate integration and deployment
  - Automate testing and rollback

### Operational Readiness and Change Management
- Ensure personnel capability
- Ensure a consistent review of operational readiness
- Use runbooks to perform procedures
- Use playbooks to investigate issues
- Make informed decisions to deploy systems and changes
- Facilitate support plans for production workloads
